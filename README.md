# Hi, Intercom! ðŸ‘‹


## Prerequisites
- Node.js / npm installed
- Typescript installed


## Getting started

In order to build & run the project:
```shell script
npm run build
npm run start
```

In order to run all the tests:
```shell script
npm run test
```

That's about it â€“ short on time?  
<b>The output of the script can be found in output.txt</b>
